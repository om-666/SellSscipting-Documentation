**Basics:**

The following are basic commands and concepts in Bash scripting:

1. **`cat` Command:** `cat` is used to display the contents of a file. It outputs the file's content line by line on the terminal screen.

2. **`echo` Command:** `echo` is used to print content to the terminal.

3. **`ls` Command:** `ls` lists files in the current directory.

4. **`pwd` Command:** `pwd` shows the current working directory.

5. **`echo $SHELL`:** This command specifies that Bash is the active shell.

6. **Shebang Line:** `#!/bin/bash` is the shebang line, indicating the script should be interpreted using the Bash shell.

7. **`ls -l` Command:** `ls -l` checks file permissions and provides detailed information about files.

8. **`chmod` Command:** `chmod owner u+x filename` gives permission to the owner to execute the program.

9. **`./Filename.sh`:** This is used to run a Bash script file.

**Variables:**

Variables are used to store data. In Bash:

```bash
First_name=OmTanmaya
echo "pati $First_name"
```

In this example, the variable `First_name` stores the value "OmTanmaya" and then it's printed using `echo`.

**Positional Arguments:**

Positional arguments are values provided to a script or a function at the time of execution.
